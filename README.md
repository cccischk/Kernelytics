# Kernelytics
This is a collection of my research from my Summer 2025 Baseball Analytics
internship with the Normal Cornbelters.

The repository is still a work in progress, and I will continue to be cleaning
and adding to my code throughout Fall 2025.

# Important Files
Main files of interest:

* ump_report.R *
This file includes data cleaning and classification functions, making up the bulk
of my umpire accuracy model. 

* zone_analysis.R *
This file includes further exploration of the strike zone, including the KCL
Expected Zone and plots of strike percentages by various criteria (i.e. batter
handedness)

* updated_umpire_report.Rmd *
This file is the Rmd file for the reports I generated for each game in the season.
This file sources ump_report.R and zone_analysis.R.
The reports can be found in the Season Reports folder of this repository.
